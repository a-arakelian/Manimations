### Problem   (animations 0-10)
    - Draw a green circle with center O.
    - Draw a chord AB, such that \angle AOB is about 40 degree.
    - Draw a midpoint of AB, denote it by M. 
    - Draw the sign of equal segments for AM and MB.
    - Connect O to M.

### Hint1   (animations 10-16)
    - Connect O to A and B.
    - Fill triangles AMO and BMO

### Hint2   (animations 16-20)
    - Draw the sign of equal segments for OA and OB.
    - Wiggle AM and BM

### Solution    (animations 21-end)
    - Crate OA and OB, fill triangles AMO and BMO
    - Show triangles AMO and BMO equality
    - Conclude angles AMO and BMO are equal 90
    - Write MO-ն AB-ի միջնուղղահայացն է
