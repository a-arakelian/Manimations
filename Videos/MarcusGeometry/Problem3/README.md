# SCENE Problem3
Prove that the three points on the same line doesn't belong to the same circle.

## DONE
- Draw a yellow line in the bottom of the screen and choose point A, B and C.
- Draw a random green circle and move it randomly until it touches point A.
- Rotate it (around point A) until touches the point B. 
- Increase the radius of the circle such that it touches A and B.
- Decrease the radius of the circle such that it touches A and B.
- Draw the blue bisector perpendicular of AB. Denote it by l_1.
- Mention center of the circle O.
- Increase the radius of the circle such that it touches A and B. (O is on the bisector perpendicular)
- Decrease the radius of the circle such that it touches A and B. (O is on the bisector perpendicular)
- Change position of the circle such that it touches points B and C.
- Increase the radius of the circle such that it touches C and B.
- Decrease the radius of the circle such that it touches C and B.
- Draw the blue bisector perpendicular of BC. 
- Denote it by l_2.
- Mention center of the circle O.
- Increase the radius of the circle such that it touches C and B. (O is on the bisector perpendicular)
- Decrease the radius of the circle such that it touches C and B. (O is on the bisector perpendicular)
- Draw 90 degree angle between l_1 and the original line.
- Draw 90 degree angle between l_2 and the original line.
- Write 90 + 90 = 180 => l_1 || l_2.
