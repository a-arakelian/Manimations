# SCENE Problem2

Done, waiting for audio

Let AB is the diameter and AC is a chord of the circle with center O. Let K be the midpoint of AC. Find the length of the segment BC if it is known that OK=4sm.

### Functions
- 
see more about each functions in their docstrings.

### Animations
- Draw point yellow point O, then green circle with center O.
- Then draw horizontal diameter AB, then chord AC.
- Choose midpoint of AC, mention it K and draw sign of equal segments for AK and KC.
- Connect O and K, then draw 4 close to the segment OK. 
- Connect B and C.
- Mention the sign of equal segments for AO and OB.
- Make AK thinner then thicker.
- Make KC thinner then thicker.
- Make AO thinner then thicker.
- Make BO thinner then thicker.
- Write below of the graph BC=2*OK=2*4=8. (Write 4 by moving the copy of the number 4 from the graph).
- Move the copy of 8 close to the segment BC.
- Draw green rectangle (box) around the number 8.
