# SCENE Problem5
Draw a circle of given radius that passed the given 2 points.

## WHAT IS DONE

### Functions
- 
see more about each function in it's docstring.

### Animations
- Draw a points A and B (ORANGE) and a circle with the center O, such that the radius is bigger than AB/2.
- Move randomly the circle, until it meets the point A.
- When they meet, point A and the circle become thicker, then return back to normal size.
- Rotate the circle around the point A, such that meets the point B.
- At that moment the point B and the circle become thicker, then return back to normal size. (CIRCLE 1).
- Draw segments OA and OB (ORANGE). 
- Add sign of equal sizes on OA and OB.
- Remove the circle, such that it remains isosceles triangle AOB.
- Take the midpoint M of the segment AB and draw the line MO (thick green line).
- Add signs of equal segments for AM and BM
- Add the sign of 90 degree to the angles AMO and BMO.Increase the radius of the circle, such that it passes points A and B, but O changes but keeps on green line.
- Stop a moment and start to decrease the radius, until M coincides with O.
- Continue to move O, until the radius becomes the original one (but in another side of the line AB). (CIRCLE 2).
- Remove segments OA, OB, line AB and point O (it remain only points A, B and CIRCLE 2).
- Add the original circle, that satisfied the condition (CIRCLE 1)
- Draw OA and OB (ORANGE).
- Draw a sign of equal sizes on radiuses of CIRCLE1 and CIRCLE 2 that connect to A and B.
- Draw a circle with center A and radius OA (blue).
- Draw a circle with center B and radius OB (blue).
- Delete CIRCLE 1 and CIRCLE 2.
- Make intersection points of blue circles (O and another one) thinner and return to normal size.
- Delete blue circles.
- Draw CIRCLE 1
- Draw CIRCLE 2.
- Delete everything but points A and B.
- Draw a circle with radius < AB/2 with the center where the original point O was.
- Write r < AB/2
- Move the circle, until it meets point A.
- Rotate around A 360 degree with success to touch point B.
- Move circle to the middle of segment AB.
- Move it up, then move it down.
