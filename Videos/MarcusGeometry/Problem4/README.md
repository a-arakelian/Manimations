## WHAT IS DONE

### Functions
- 
see more about each function in it's docstring.

### Animations
- Draw a green circle with diameters AB (orange) and center O(orange).
- Draw a point C on the circle (close to A) and connect it to A and B. Draw blue AC and white BC.
- Move point C among the circle and simultaneously make CA and CB Yellow 
- When C arrives to the center of the AB, stop and make chords AC and BC thicker and return to normal size
- Draw sign of equal sizes on AC and BC.
- Blink 2 times the segments Ac and CB.
- Draw a sign of equal segments for AO and OB.
- Blink 2 times the segments OC.
- Draw the following text below the circle: "АC=CB => ABC եռանկյունը հավասարասրուն է և CO միջնագիծը կլինի նաև բարձրություն, ուստի< АОC = 90^o"
- Draw a blue rectangle around the number 90^o..
- Draw a sign of 90 degrees to the angle COA.
- Move the copy of number 90 from the text <AOC=90^o to the angle AOC.
