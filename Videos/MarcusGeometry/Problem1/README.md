# SCENE Problem1

Done, waiting for audio

How must be the orientation of the point and the segment, such that one can draw a circle with
center at the point, that passes through the endpoints of the segment.

## DONE

### Functions
- 
see more about functions in their docstrings.

### Animations
- Draw segment orange segment AB and a point O, such that OA < OB. 
- Draw a small circle with center O and radius smaller than OA.
- Start to increase the radius of the circle, until in touches the point A.
- At that moment blink the circle and the point A.
- Then continue to increase the radius until it touches the point B. 
- At that moment blink the circle and the point B.
- Stop changing the radius. 
- Now move O, such that it touches B, O moves parallel to AB, closer to the bisector perpendicular of AB.
- Continue it until the circle touches tbe point A as well. Stop animation.
- Draw radiuses OA and OB, put sign of equal segments on them. 
- Draw the midpoint of AB as M.
- Draw the bisector perpendicular of AB, it must pass through point O.
- Highlight triangles AOM and BOM in different colors.
- Remove highlights.
- Now move point O over the bisector perpendicular, such that the circle changes it's radius
    and passes through points A and B.
