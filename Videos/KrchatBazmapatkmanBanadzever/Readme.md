## NEEDS TO BE DONE

### Functions
- didn't think of that yet

### Animations
- Write (a+b)^2 in the top left corner
- Create Line with length a+b (horizontal)
- Create Line with length a+b (Vertical)
- Create a Square with that sides and name - whole_square
- Color the whole_square
- Copy that Square to the rght and name - devided_square
- Create seperating lines inside the devided_square
- Color each area of the devided_square
- Transform area of the whole_square into (a+b)^2 (which will be below the square)
- Transform the areas of the devided_square into a^2+ab+ab+b^2 one at a time (which will be below the square)
- Transform ab+ab into 2ab
- Add the equality sign between (a+b)^2 and a^2+2ab+b^2
