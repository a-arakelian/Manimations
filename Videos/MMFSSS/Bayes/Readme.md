# Animation of Bayes theorem
Animation consists of these parts (yet)
- A square is added on the screen which is devided into 4 parts and colored
    - in left colomn hypothesis is true, in right colomn hypothesis is not true
    - in the bottom parts evidence is true, in the upper parts evidence is false
    - bottom left is (H and E)
    - upper left is (H and -E)
    - bottom right is (-H and E)
    - upper right is (-H and -E)
- A unit rectangle is created to the right of the square
- (H and E) and (-H and E) areas are Transformed and fitted into the unit rectangle
- The same parts are Transormed and a rfaction is created which is (H and E) / (H and E)+(-H and E)
- The proportions in the square are changing and the proportions in unit rectangle and in the fraction are changing accordingly
